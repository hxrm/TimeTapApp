## User experience and functionality features
We have incorporated several valuable features into our timesheet app to enhance user experience and functionality:
•	Password Recovery: If a user forgets their password, they can simply click on the "Forgot Password" link, enter 
their email address, and receive a message with instructions to reset their password.
•	Profile Management: Once logged in, users can view and edit their profile details to keep their information up to date.
•	Project Creation: Users can create new projects within the app. Once a project is created, users can then generate 
associated timesheets to log their work hours.
•	Category Management: We have included a page dedicated to adding categories. Once a category is created, it will 
appear in a dropdown menu under the timesheet page for easy selection during timesheet creation.
•	Task Management: Users can start and finish tasks within their projects. Upon project completion, users 
receive streaks and points as rewards for their efforts.
•	Timesheet and Category Lists: Users can view lists of their timesheets and categories, organized by the date 
each timesheet was started. This allows for easy tracking and management of work records.
•	Analytics and Reporting: The app features an analytics graph that shows the total hours worked each day over 
a user-selectable period. This provides users with a visual representation of their productivity and work patterns.
•	Streaks and Points: As an added feature, users can earn streaks and points based on their activity and project 
completions, encouraging consistent usage and productivity.

## Innovative Features
Streaks and Points: we have come up with this innovative gamification feature for users to earn streaks and points based on their activity and project 
completions, encouraging consistent usage and productivity.

Comprehensive User Profile: The user profile should provide detailed insights into the user’s productivity 
habits, including statistics on total projects completed, average weekly hours, and current streaks of 
meeting daily goals. This centralized dashboard allows users to monitor progress, set personal objectives, 
and adjust goals based on performance​ (Subotin, 2024)​.
